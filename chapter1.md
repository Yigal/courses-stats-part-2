The values of a quantitative variable are usually distributed in one of several ways, depending on the process that generates those values. [Click here to see different distributions](http://simple-tech.com/public_html/statistics/distributions.html).

Which of these distributions has mostly low values with a few high ones?

## Uniform distribution

```yaml
type: PureMultipleChoiceExercise
key: b0025d5748
xp: 50
```

In a [uniform distribution](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/UniformDistribution.html) each value has an equal probability. For example, when you throw dice you have an equal chance of getting 1, 2, 3, etc.
