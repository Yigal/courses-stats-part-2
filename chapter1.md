## Distributions

```yaml

```

The values of a quantitative variable are usually distributed in one of several ways, depending on the process that generates those values. [Click here to see different distributions](http://simple-tech.com/public_html/statistics/distributions.html).

Which of these distributions has mostly low values with a few high ones?

`@possible_answers`
- Normal
- [Exponential]
- Uniform
- Bernoulli

## Uniform distribution

```yaml
type: PureMultipleChoiceExercise
key: b0025d5748
xp: 50
```

In a [uniform distribution](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/UniformDistribution.html) each value has an equal probability. For example, when you throw dice you have an equal chance of getting each value.

What is the chance of getting either one or six?

`@hint`
There are six possibilities uniformly distributed, so the chance of each is $\frac{1}{6}$. The two events, one and six, are mutually exclusive so the chance of either happening is the chance of one plus the chance of the other.

`@possible_answers`
- $0$, it cannot happen
- $\frac{1}{6}$
- [$\frac{1}{3}$]
- $\frac{1}{2}$
- $\frac{2}{3}$
- $\frac{5}{6}$
- $1$, it always happens

## Normal distribution

```yaml
type: PureMultipleChoiceExercise
key: 8237108b01

```

When you add multiple uniformly distributed variables, you get a distribution that has more entries in the middle than in the edges. For example, if you add the results of two dice throws, you get a graph like this one:
